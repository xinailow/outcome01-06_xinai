	<h1><u>Describe and apply the basics of web page development.</u></h1>
	<h1>1. Describe the common devices of screen resolution for web pages.</h1>
	<h2>Answer:</h2>
	
	Every devices has their own size. therefore, every content that present is different if we use different devices. For example, if we use laptop to see the content, the content is look bigger than we using mobile to watch it.

PNG is also a good choice for images that require transparency. Recommended PNG format for capturing web pages, logos and lines. GIF is great for clipart and drawings where limited colors are in use.
		
	<h1>Disadvantages</h1>
		
	The Jpeg file format can produce smaller files for images that have photographic like content, or where there are large areas of colour gradients. GIF has the advantages of its own shortcomings, because they only have 256 colors of the largest palette, so sometimes you may see worse quality than other types of files or images. PNG does not support animation, is not suitable for full-color images, and cannot store multiple images in a single file.

	The factors that affect the file size of an image is file compression. The role of compression technology is that most of the data in most cases is redundant. Redundancy can be explained by a large number of background pixels with the same or similar color. By lossless decompression, the data is the same as the original data. Using decompression, some data is removed and decompressed, can changes the file size different from the original.
